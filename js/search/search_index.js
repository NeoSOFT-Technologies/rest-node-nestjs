quickly building RESTful APIs using Node.js, NestsJS, Express, and MySQL.\nBy running one command, you will get a production-ready Node.js app installed and configured on your machine. There are many built-in features in the skeleton, including authentication using JWT, request validation, unit and integration tests, continuous integration, docker support, API documentation, pagination, etc. To learn more about its features, check out the following list.\nDescription\n\nNest framework TypeScript starter repository.\n\nNest provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify) but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This allows developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.\n\nThere are superb libraries, helpers, and tools that exist for Node (and server-side JavaScript), none of them effectively solve the main problem of — Architecture.\n\n\nTake it for a test drive. We'd love to hear any feedback you have or if you've thought of a new feature.\nTable of Contents\n\nFeatures\nGetting started\nProject Structure\nDocumentation\nMiscellaneous\nTrainings\nVideo Tutorials\nContributing To This Project\nIssues and Discussions\nStay in touch\n\nFeatures\n\nQuick start\nIntegrated ESLint, Prettier and Husky\nSimple and Standard scaffolding\nProduction-Ready Skeleton\nFollowed SOLID Principles\nAuthentication and authorization: using passport\nValidation: request data validation using Nest JS Pipe\nLogging: using winston \nTesting: unit and integration tests using Jest\nError handling: centralized error handling mechanism\nAPI documentation: with swagger \nProcess management: advanced production process management using PM2\nDependency management: with npm\nEnvironment variables: using dotenv and cross-env\nAPI Versioning\nSecurity: set security HTTP headers using helmet\nSantizing: sanitize request data against xss and query injection\nCORS: Cross-Origin Resource-Sharing enabled using cors\nCompression: gzip compression with compression\nCI: Continuous integration with Travis CI\nDocker support\nGit hooks: with husky and lint-staged\nLinting: with ESLint and Prettier\nEditor config: consistent editor configuration using EditorConfig\n\nGetting started\nPrerequisites\n\nNode https://nodejs.org/en/ use the LTS version\nNPM\nDocker https://www.docker.com/\nInstall Docker Desktop for MAC: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/\nInstall Docker Desktop for Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/\n\n\nDocker Compose\nNestJS CLI https://nestjs.com/\n\nSetup\nTo get started, clone the repository to your local computer. Use the following command to run in your terminal.\nClone The Application\n// clone the application\n$ git clone https://github.com/NeoSOFT-Technologies/rest-node-nestjs.gitInstall The Dependencies\nNext, install the packages that are required for this project.\n// Install the required npm modules\n$ npm installCreate The Environment Variables\nThe config/env/.env file should be placed in root folder with the following variables.\n\nconfig/env/.env : Default Environment File\nconfig/env/.env.dev : Development Environment File\nconfig/env/.env.test : Test Environment File\nconfig/env/.env.prod : Production Environment File\n\n# config/env/.env.example\n\nAPP_NAME=rest_api\nNODE_ENV=dev\nDB_HOST=127.0.0.1\nDB_DATABASE=rest_api\nDB_USER=user\nDB_PASSWORD=root\nDB_PORT=3306Start MySQL Database\nIn order to use mysql, you need to have it installed in your local machine.\nDocker Compose is what we will be using in our case, In the project directory, execute the following command.\n# build images, create and run containers in background\ndocker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file ./config/env/.env up -dIn order to apply your modified code to a running container, you should add a build option.\n# if source code is changed, rebuild image, recreate and start container\ndocker-compose  -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file ./config/env/.env up -d --buildRunning the app\n# development\n$ npm run start\n\n# watch mode\n$ npm run start:dev\n\n# production mode\n$ npm run start:prodTest\nFor this project, We chose Jest as our test framework.\nWhile Mocha is probably more common, Mocha seems to be looking for a new maintainer and setting up TypeScript testing in Jest is wicked simple.\n# unit tests\n$ npm run test\n\n# e2e tests\n$ npm run test:e2e\n\n# test coverage\n$ npm run test:covRunning the build\nAll the different build steps are orchestrated via npm scripts.\nNpm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.\nThis is nice because most JavaScript tools have easy to use command line utilities allowing us to not need grunt or gulp to manage our builds.\nIf you open package.json, you will see a scripts section with all the different scripts you can call.\nTo call a script, simply run npm run  from the command line.\nYou'll notice that npm scripts can call each other which makes it easy to compose complex builds out of simple individual build scripts.\nBelow is a list of all the scripts this template has available:\n\n\n\nNpm Script\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nbuild\nFull build. Runs ALL build tasks\n\n\nstart:debug\nPerforms a full build and then serves the app in watch mode\n\n\nlint\nRuns ESLint on project files\n\n\nformat\nRuns the file formatter\n\n\nserve\nRuns node on dist/server.js which is the apps entry point\n\n\nstart\nDoes the same as 'npm run serve'.

Make sure you have already built the app using  npm run build\n\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n.vscode\nContains VS Code specific settings\n\n\n.github\nContains GitHub settings and configurations, including the GitHub Actions workflows\n\n\ndist\nContains the distributable (or output) from your TypeScript build. This is the code you ship\n\n\nnode_modules\nContains all your npm dependencies\n\n\nsrc\nContains your source code that will be compiled to the dist dir\n\n\nsrc/config\nHere you will find all the environment configuration necessary to access the application e.g. .env\n\n\nsrc/components\nComponents define group of files/source that respond to various module(http requests)\n\n\nsrc/components/${module_name}/dto/\nDTO (Data Transfer Object) Schema, Validation\n\n\nsrc/components/${module_name}/entities/\nEntities belongs to that Component\n\n\nsrc/components/${module_name}/repository/\nRepository belongs to that Component\n\n\nsrc/components/${module_name}/services/\nServices belongs to that Component\n\n\nsrc/components/${module_name}/module_name.controllers.ts\nController belongs to that Component\n\n\nsrc/components/${module_name}/module_name.module.ts\nModule belongs to that Component\n\n\nsrc/core\nAll core modules - Guards, Http Request & Response Handler, Logger\n\n\nsrc/main.ts\nEntry point to your express app\n\n\ntest\nContains your tests. Separate from source because there is a different build process.\n\n\nconfig/env/.env.example\nAPI keys, tokens, passwords, database URI. Clone this, but don't check it in to public repos.\n\n\npackage.json\nFile that contains npm dependencies\n\n\ntsconfig.json\nConfig settings for compiling server code written in TypeScript\n\n\ntsconfig.build.json\nConfig settings for compiling tests written in TypeScript\n\n\n.eslintrc\nConfig settings for ESLint code style checking\n\n\n.eslintignore\nConfig settings for paths to exclude from linting\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n1. Generation with compdoc\nGenerate project documentation using the following command (npm 6 is required for npx support). See the official documentation for more options.\nnpm run doc\nOR\nnpx @compodoc/compodoc -p tsconfig.json -s\n2. Request and Response Cycle\n\nAn explanation of how the request and response cycle works is provided here\n\n2.1 Request and Response Workflow\n\nBoilerplate has a custom guard enabled for handling response and request for every api. The integration of request response guard is enabled by default with response structure\n\n\n2.2 Request Workflow\n\nBy creating a workflow, you can specify the template that should be used to create a change request when a request for service is logged.\n\n\n3.

We need to provide SMTP credentials in .env in the desired format mentioned below.\nMailer module also supports the attachment functionality.\nWe need to define the email template folder from where we need fetch the email template.\nCurrently we support pug email templates\nThe third-party service that we are using is the nodemailer package.\n\nPug\nPug is a high performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for Node.js and browsers. This library is used for designing the template of the email body.\nInstall Dependencies\nFirst we need to install the nodemailer package by the following command.\nnpm install --save nodemailerThe below command is executed to support .ts files.\nnpm install --save @types/nodemailerTo install Pug template execute the following instruction.\nFor .js\nnpm install --save pugFor .ts\nnpm install --save @types/pugConfiguration\nTo configure the SMTP service we need to add below values in the environment. The values are self explanatory.  \nEMAIL_HOST=\nEMAIL_PORT=\nUSER_EMAIL=\nUSER_PASSWORD=Once the .env is setup then the values of the .env file will be imported in the application with the help of mailer.ts file present in the config directory.\nexport default registerAs('mailer', () => ({\nfromEmail: process.env.USER_EMAIL,\nhost: process.env.EMAIL_HOST ,\nport: process.env.EMAIL_PORT ,\nusername: process.env.USER_EMAIL ,\npassword: process.env.USER_PASSWORD ,\n}));Usability\nSince Mailer is required in every module it is the part of the CoreModule imports.\nAlso it is an independent module hence a mailer.module.ts file is being created in which we have provided the EmailHandlerService.\n@Module({\n  providers: [EmailHandlerService],\n  exports: [EmailHandlerService],\n})\nexport class EmailHandlerModule {}The class EmailHandlerModule can be used via importing it in any of the core module such as Users module or App module etc. Consider we want to use the Mailer module in the Users module. It can  be done simply by the below steps. First import the EmailHandlerModule in the user.module.ts file.\n@Module({\n  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([UserDbRepository]), EmailHandlerModule],\n  providers: [UsersService],\n  controllers: [UsersController],\n})\nexport class UsersModule {}Now since we need it in the User module we need to add the EmailHandlerService as a dependency in the user.controller.ts file.\nconstructor(private readonly emailService: EmailHandlerService) {} \nFinally to trigger an email, we need pass below parameters to sendMail function in EmailHandlerService.\nIn this case we are sending template as a mail.\n await this.emailService.sendEmail({\n        to:'',\n        subject:'subject',\n        templateName:'sample',\n        replace:{'name': ''},\n });The paramenters of the sendEmail function are self explanatory. The templateName parameter defines the template od the email that we are going to send through the  sendEmail function.\nThe value sample is the sample.pug file which contains the template that is to be sent in the mail. The .pug should be kept in the template fol\n\ntemplate: The .pug file should be kept in the template folder whose directory might be in the following format /src/core/mailer/template/sample.pug\n\nAt the same time if we want to send a textbody via email then it has to be defined\nin as a value against the body parameter. Use the following snippet of the code.\n await this.emailService.sendEmail({\n        to:'',\n        subject:'subject',\n        body:'This is email body',\n });\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/modules/database.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/modules/database.html","title":"additional-page - Database","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase\nBoiler plate has already included mysql and mongodb database configuration within the core modules. To leverage the functionality, we need to define the database connection in database.module.ts which is in db folder inside src. Update the database configuration as per your setting.\nInstallation\nFor integrating with SQL and NoSQL databases, Nest provides the @nestjs/typeorm package. Nest uses TypeORM because it's the most mature Object Relational Mapper (ORM) available for TypeScript. Since it's written in TypeScript, it integrates well with the Nest framework.TypeORM provides support for many relational databases, such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, and even NoSQL databases like MongoDB.\n$ npm install --save @nestjs/typeorm typeormNow proceed to install the associated client API libraries for selected database.\nFor MySQL install mysql\n$ npm install --save mysql2For MongoDB install MongoDB NodeJS Driver.We install older version as typeorm does not support mongodb driver for v4\n$ npm install --save mongodb@3.7.0\nNote: It is a best practice to import database information from application configuration.\n\nConfiguration\n# database.module.ts\n\n@Module({\n  imports: [\n    TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync({\n      name: 'mysql_connection',\n      imports: [ConfigModule],\n      inject: [ConfigService],\n      useFactory: (config: ConfigService) => ({\n        type: 'mysql',\n        host: config.get('db.host'),\n        port: config.get('db.port1'),\n        username: config.get('db.username'),\n        password: config.get('db.password'),\n        database: config.get('db.database'),\n        entities: [User],\n        // entities: [__dirname + '/**/*.entity{.ts,.js}'],\n        synchronize: config.get('app.env') === 'local' || 'dev' ? true : false,\n      }\n      ),\n    }),\n    TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync({\n      name: 'mongoDB_connection',\n      imports: [ConfigModule],\n      inject: [ConfigService],\n      useFactory: (config: ConfigService) => ({\n        type: 'mongodb',\n        host: config.get('db.host'),\n        port: config.get('db.port2'),\n        username: config.get('db.username'),\n        password: config.get('db.password'),\n        database: config.get('db.database'),\n        useUnifiedTopology: true,\n        authSource: 'admin',\n        entities: [User],\n        synchronize: config.get('app.env') === 'local' || 'dev' ? true : false,\n      }),\n    }),\n  ],\n})type:   Database type. Must specify which database engine to use.\nhost:   Database host.\nport:   Database host port. Default mysql port is 3306 & default mongodb port is 27017.\nusername:   Database username.\npassword:   Database password.\ndatabase:   Database name.\nuseUnifiedTopology:   Determines whether or not to use the new Server Discovery and Monitoring engine.\nauthSource:   If the Database authentication is dependent on another databaseName\nentities:   Entities that maps with database table. It is shown below\n# users.entity.ts\n\n@Entity()\nexport class User {\n  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()\n  @ObjectIdColumn()\n  id: string;\n\n  @Column()\n  firstName: string;\n\n  @Column()\n  lastName: string;\n\n  @Column({ default: true })\n  isActive: boolean;\n}synchronize:   Synchronize the entities with databases. Should not be enabled for production.\n\nUsing the forFeature() method repositories are registered in the current scope.\n\n# users.module.ts\n\n    @Module({\n    imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([UserDbRepository],'mongoDB_connection')],\n    providers: [UsersService],\n    controllers: [UsersController],\n    })\nInject UserDbRepository using @InjectRepository decorator\n\n# users.service.ts\n\nconstructor(\n    @InjectRepository(UserDbRepository,'mongoDB_connection')\n    private readonly usersRepository: UserRepository\n  ) {}Using other database apart from MySQL and MongoDb.\nThe existing boiler plate comes with by default support for MySQL. This doesn't mean that you cannot use any other database like  PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server etc. Install the respective package of the database and update the config.ts as per required database configuration.\n\n\nNoSQL injections\nA NoSQL injection vulnerability is an error in a web application that uses a NoSQL database. This web application security issue lets a malicious party bypass authentication, extract data, modify data, or even gain complete control over the application. NoSQL injection attacks are the result of a lack of data sanitization.\nNoSQL injections are just one of many injection attacks, similar to traditional SQL Injections. They are engineered to exploit modern databases that do not use SQL. While NoSQL database engines have a different structure and do not support SQL statements and SQL queries, they still let users perform queries. They do not support one standardized language and therefore the query language is dependent on the implementation: database (e.g. MongoDB), language, and framework (e.g. Node.js, Angular). However, NoSQL queries are most often based on JSON and they can include user input. If this input is not sanitized, they are vulnerable to injections.\n\nTypes Of Injection Attacks\n\nIn-band Injections : In-band Injection is the most common and easy-to-exploit of Injection attacks. In-band Injection occurs when an attacker is able to use the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results. As an example, an attacker may use the HTTP communication deploy the attack to a backend and get the results on the same channel\n\nInferential Injection (Blind Injection): In an inferential attack, no data is actually transferred via the web application and the attacker would not be able to see the result of an attack in-band. Instead, an attacker is able to reconstruct the database structure by sending payloads, observing the web application’s response and the resulting behavior of the database server.\nBlind injection is nearly identical to normal injection, the only difference being the way the data is retrieved from the database. When the database does not output data to the web page, an attacker is forced to steal data by asking the database a series of true or false questions. This makes exploiting the Injection vulnerability more difficult, but not impossible.\n\nOut-of-band Injections: This not very common type of injection, mostly because it depends on features being enabled on the database server being used by the web application. Out-of-band Injection occurs when an attacker is unable to use the same channel to launch the attack and gather results.\n\n\nHow to prevent injection attacks\n\nTry to avoid building queries from strings, use safe APIs and prepared statements.\nValidate input to detect malicious values, also verify the types of input data i.e. string, number, Boolean, object etc. We can use joi or any other tool for this.\nTo minimize the potential damage of a successful injection attack, do not assign DBA or admin type access rights to your application accounts, we can create new roles with specific/limited access.\nSanitize the data, we can use express-mongo-sanitize to sanitize incoming data for express mongoDB.\n\nDatabase Vulnerabilty against injection\n\n\n\nConnection type\nWith ORM\nWithout ORM\n\n\n\n\nSecurity\nRisk is low Data sanitization not requiredGenerates \"parameterized statements\"\nRisk is high Data sanitization required\"parameterized statements\" needs to written manually\n\n\n\nTypeORM provide many ways to construct a database query, but they also give you the option to execute 'raw' queries as a string.Also they allow to write some part of a generated query as a raw string. This should to be avoided, as it defeats the purpose of using an ORM.\nIn that scenario, simply injecting user input variables into a string query (instead of using the ORM's core API / query builder functions) puts data security at a higher risk.\nData sanitization for MongoDB\nWe can use express-mongo-sanitize for this purpose,if required.This module searches for any keys in objects that begin with a $ sign or contain a ., from req.body, req.query or req.params. It can then either:\n\ncompletely remove these keys and associated data from the object, or\nreplace the prohibited characters with another allowed character.\n\nObject keys starting with a $ or containing a . are reserved for use by MongoDB as operators. Without this sanitization, malicious users could send an object containing a $ operator, or including a ., which could change the context of a database operation. Most notorious is the $where operator, which can execute arbitrary JavaScript on the database.The best way to prevent this is to sanitize the received data, and remove any offending keys, or replace the characters with a 'safe' one.\n\nSimple add the the middleware after installing the library as shown below\n\n# bootsrap.ts\n...\nimport  mongoSanitize  from 'express-mongo-sanitize';\n\n...\napp.use(mongoSanitize());\n...\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/modules/pattern.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/modules/pattern.html","title":"additional-page - Pattern","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign Pattern\nClean architecture\n\nSeparation of concerns at the architectural level\n\nThis document defines the design pattern for developing any web api application. We intend to follow clean architecture. Dividing the application into multiple layers like Domain layer, Service layer, Repository layer etc. The implementation of these layer would explained via example. For more understanding kindly refer Clean Architecture related articles.\nIn this boiler plate, we define the methods and techniques that would useful for building and maintaining web app build in NestJS. NestJS itself has covered alot techniques like TypeORM, Dependency Injection and so on. This document help us to utilize functionality and follow clean architecture.\n\nIn the above diagram, we code the see the how does the request flows from controller to database. There are lot of aspects that need to consider in this, like external api calls, caching etc which would be covered later.\nInversion of Control (IoC)\nIn software engineering, inversion of control (IoC) is a programming principle. IoC inverts the flow of control as compared to traditional control flow. In IoC, custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework. A software architecture with this design inverts control as compared to traditional procedural programming: in traditional programming, the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.\nBelow is the inversion of flow for the boiler plate which has been used for user module.\n\nThe control flows from UserController to UserService, we have DTO defined for transfering data between classes eg. create.user.dto, update.user.dto\nUnderstanding the implementation of clean code in boilerplate\nTo start with let's understand the folder structure and files first.\n\nApp.module — the core of the project, here we import modules that are providing functionalities.\nusers.module — this module will be imported by AppModule to provide everything that is related to our users.\nusers.controller — Here we declare our endpoints with all parameters.\nentities — in this place we declare our User class.\ndto— data transfer object — a bunch of interfaces for communication with the application.\nrepository — in this place we define all the queries related to database or external IO.\nservices - in this place we have our business logic defined\nNow let us go through each folder\n1. entities\nIn this folder, we have defined the database table fields that is required for that entity. TypeORM has some build-in helpers like PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column etc. Ref: TypeORM documentation\n2. dto\nIn this folder, we have defined the the data transfer object that would be used to communicated between classes. DTO are helpful for avoid leak of unwanted data or fields\n3. repository\nIn this folder, we have defined the database queries related to the entity. We have used typeORM for fetching or saving data. Before defining the implementation of the repository, it is a good practice to define an interface of the repository.\n4. services\nIn this folder, we have defined the business logic related to the entity. For executing the db queries, we use the repository. Repository and services are loosely coupled with the repository interface.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/modules/crypto.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/modules/crypto.html","title":"additional-page - Crypto","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEncryption-Decryption\nEncryption-Decryption module is present in the Boiler Plate. We have used the crypto library in order to implement the encryption decryption functionality.\nThe objective of Encryption-Decryption module\n\nThis module would support sending the requests to the server from the user in encrypted form and also encryptingthe reponses that the user will receive from the server.\nWe need to provide a flag variable which tells us whether we need to encrypt the data or not in the .env file.\nAlso we need to define the constants such as which algorithm to be used for encryption in the crypto.ts file.\nCurrently we are using aes-256-gcm algorithm for encryption and decryption.\n\nConfiguration\nTo start the encryption-decryption service we need to set the APPLY_ENCRYPTION variable to 1 in the .env file.\nAPPLY_ENCRYPTION=We can also set these constants according to our preference in the crypto.ts file.\nconst inputEncoding= \nconst outputEncoding= \nconst salt= \nconst algorithm= \nconst password= Usability\nSince we require to encrypt the request and responses of the application, Encryption-Decryption service is being included in the core module.\nWhat is the main difference between a key, an IV and a nonce?\nA key, in the context of symmetric cryptography, is something you keep secret. Anyone who knows your key (or can guess it) can decrypt any data you've encrypted with it (or forge any authentication codes you've calculated with it, etc.).\nAn IV or initialization vector is, in its broadest sense, just the initial value used to start some iterated process. The term is used in a couple of different contexts and implies different security requirements in each of them.\nA nonce, in the broad sense, is just \"a number used only once\". The only thing generally demanded of a nonce is that it should never be used twice (within the relevant scope, such as encryption with a particular key). The unique IVs used for block cipher encryption qualify as nonces, but various other cryptographic schemes make use of nonces as well.\nWhy does the Signal protocol use AES/CBC instead of AES/GCM?\nAES-GCM Disadvantage\nWhy would I ever use AES-256-CBC if AES-256-GCM is more secure?\nHow to choose an Authenticated Encryption mode\nNode.js - AES Encryption/Decryption with AES-256-GCM using random Initialization Vector + Salt\nEncryption algorithms should be used with secure mode and padding scheme\n\nEncryption operation mode and the padding scheme should be chosen appropriately to guarantee data confidentiality, integrity and authenticity:\n\nFor block cipher encryption algorithms (like AES):\nThe GCM (Galois Counter Mode) mode which works internally with zero/no padding scheme, is recommended, as it is designed to provide both data authenticity (integrity) and confidentiality. Other similar modes are CCM, CWC, EAX, IAPM and OCB.\nThe CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode by itself provides only data confidentiality, it’s recommended to use it along with Message Authentication Code or similar to achieve data authenticity (integrity) too and thus to prevent padding oracle attacks.\nThe ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode doesn’t provide serious message confidentiality: under a given key any given plaintext block always gets encrypted to the same ciphertext block. This mode should not be used.\nFor RSA encryption algorithm, the recommended padding scheme is OAEP.\n\n\n\n\nNoncompliant Code Example\n\nNoncompliant: CBC with PKCS5/7 (set by default) is vulnerable to oracle padding attacks\n\n  crypto.createCipheriv(\"AES-128-CBC\", key, iv);\n\nNoncompliant: ECB doesn't provide serious message confidentiality\n\n  crypto.createCipheriv(\"AES-128-ECB\", key, \"\");\n\nCompliant Solution\n\n\ncrypto.createCipheriv(\"AES-256-GCM\", key, iv);\nTest\nhttps://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/modules/open-api/swagger.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/modules/open-api/swagger.html","title":"additional-page - Open API/Swagger","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwagger/Open API\n\nThe OpenAPI specification is a language-agnostic definition format used to describe RESTful APIs.
